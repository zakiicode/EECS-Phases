Title of Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors 

Project Description: 
The EECS term project that we will be attempting to complete over the remainder of this course is a Rock, Paper, Scissors program. We will be using all three coding languages(HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to create a game where a player inputs a choice of rock, paper or scissors and a computer will generate their choice as well (Player vs player option will be available too). We will create a menu for the player to choose whether they want to do pvp, pvc or view the rules of the game. If the choice is to play one of the game modes the game will ask for the player name(s). If the choice is to view the rules, then a demo video will be played showing how the game works. They also will be given an option of difficulties, if they choose to play the computer (Normal or Hard). Then, we will create a page with three choices of rock, paper or scissors, then using buttons, the player will store their answer. This will take them to a different page displaying whether they have won or not. This will be done using several if statements and loops to decide the outcome. Rather than making it look like a webpage, we will try to make it look like a game. To do this we will add background music and using css and js we will give the program a proper game aesthetic. During the selection screen, there will be three pictures displaying the options, when clicked once, the pictureâ€™s border will be green and others will be red. Then it will ask you to double click on the picture to confirm it. Also, there will be a scoreboard to show who has won 2 first. After the winner is decided, the game prompts the player asking to play again or not.
